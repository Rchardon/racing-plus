### *v0.69.9* - November 4th, 2021

- In seeded races, not entering a Treasure Room no longer increases the chance of a Planetarium spawning, which should make floor generation more consistent. (Thanks Hispa)
- Fixed the bug where Card Reading would not work correctly with Dream Catcher. (Thanks Adrayon)
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- Implement time offsets, show on the first room of each floor
