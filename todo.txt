### *v0.70.0* - November 14th, 2021

- The fast clear feature is upgraded due to new features in the latest patch. Instead of the doors opening after a 10 frame delay, they will now open after a 1 frame delay.
- The new rooms from the last vanilla patch are now present in Racing+.
- Polties and Kinetis will now immediately show themselves upon entering the room.
- Dusts will now never disappear.
- A lot of deleted rooms were put back into Racing+ now that there are fast Needles/Pasties, fast Polties/Kinetis, and fast Dusts.
- Fixed the bug where Raglings would not work properly with fast-clear.
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- Implement time offsets, show on the first room of each floor
