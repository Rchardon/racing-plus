### *v0.58.58* - August 15th, 2021

- Fixed the bug where crawlspaces in Genesis rooms on end-floors would softlock you. (They are now represented as a teleporter instead of a crawlspace to make it more clear that they are not a real crawlspace.) (Thanks Gamonymous)
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- chat system
- custom console
- Charge bars for all of the charge items
	- Azazel's Rage
- automatically open door after going to 2x1 room in mines with completed knife
- Add charge bar for No. 2
- Implement time offsets, show on the first room of each floor
