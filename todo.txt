### *v0.69.15* - November 12th, 2021

- The room changes from the last vanilla patch are now present in Racing+.
- Polties and Kinetis will now immediately show themselves upon entering the room.
- Dusts will now never disappear.
- A lot of deleted rooms were put back into Racing+ now that there are fast Needles/Pasties, fast Polties/Kinetis, and fast Dusts.
- Fixed the bug where Raglings would not work properly with fast-clear.
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- Use the new Room.Clear
- Implement time offsets, show on the first room of each floor
