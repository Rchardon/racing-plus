### *v0.72.8 - November 28th, 2021

- In seeded races, doors to Repentance floors will no longer spawn (unless the goal is Mother).
- Fixed the bug where Donation Machines would appear if you finished or quit a seeded race. (Thanks Hispa)
- Fixed the bug where 13 Luck, 15 Luck, and Sawblade were not awarded correctly. (Thanks Gamonymous)
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- Implement time offsets, show on the first room of each floor
