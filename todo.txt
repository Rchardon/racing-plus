### *v0.59.12* - August 21st, 2021

- Extra items are no longer added to the Treasure Room pool. Instead, extra starting items will appear in the first floor Treasure Room, but not in any other place that items would normally appear. Thanks to Gamonymous for coding this.
- In seeded races, Scolex will now be replaced by two Frails.
- In seeded races, special room selection will now be consistent between racers like it was in Afterbirth+.
- Duality will no longer modify the Devil Room door if the Angel Room door exists.
- Fixed the bug where the special Duality doors would not work if there were only 3 door slots.
- Fixed the bug where using the Bible on It Lives! would result in duplicate paths spawning. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where the game would crash if you tried to go to the pre-race room on a set seed. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where the game would fade out if you were in a challenge and you needed to go to the pre-race room.
- Fixed the bug where the game would crash if you saved and continued in the pre-race room.
- Fixed the bug where the client was not showing "MS" as the floor when you were in the Mega Satan room.
- Fixed the bug where the seeded floors feature would not handle Rotten Hearts properly.
- Fixed the bug where crawlspaces did not work properly on final floors. (Thanks Gamonymous)
