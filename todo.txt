### *v0.62.2* - August 29th, 2021

- Orange pills are now purple so that they are easier to distinguish from gold pills.
- Sawblade is no longer toggleable in Mod Config Menu.
- Deleted the controller fast-drop hotkeys. If you play with a controller, you must now use the keyboard fast-drop hotkeys and use Joy2Key to bind controller inputs to them. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where Horse Pills would not work properly with the pill remembering feature. (Thanks mgln)
- Fixed the bug where 48 Hour Energy! would recharge the normal active item instead of the pocket active item. (Thanks Fallenfor)
- Fixed the bug where Sawblade would be wobbly if you had BFFS!
- Fixed the bug where Checkpoint would not have a sprite on the pause menu. (Thanks Gamonymous)
