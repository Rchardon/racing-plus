### *v0.59.7* - August 20th, 2021

- Card Reading is now nerfed such that it does not spawn any portals on Womb 2 and beyond. (Similar to Mercurius, this item increases the variance of a run by too much without containing any skill-based component.)
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- make items in order on devil/angel rooms
- charge ability
- chat system
- custom console
- Charge bars for all of the charge items
	- Azazel's Rage
- automatically open door after going to 2x1 room in mines with completed knife
- Add charge bar for No. 2
- Implement time offsets, show on the first room of each floor
