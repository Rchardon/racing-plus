- Mines, Ashpit, and the Ascent are now exempt from flipping due to bugs with Bomb Grimaces. (Thanks MoucheronQuipet)
- Fixed the bug where text would not work properly in non-standard room shapes. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where the race place would not be set correctly when you were in Home. Thanks to Gamonymous for fixing this.
- Fixed the bug where fast-travel pitfalls would not spawn properly in seeded races.
- Fixed the bug where entering a room with a heaven door would not work properly on the Ascent. (Thanks Gamonymous)
