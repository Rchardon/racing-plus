### *v0.61.11* - August 28th, 2021

- The white-cyan pill is now white-green so that it is easier to distinguish from white-blue.
- Deleted the two Bumbino rooms where he is trapped in a rock cage. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where Recall would replace the D6. (It will now go to the normal active item item slot. If there is not room for a normal active item, then it will spawn on the ground.) (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where quest items were not reliably locked into place under certain conditions. (Thanks Fallenfor)
- Fixed the bug where the Holy Card feature would incorrectly play the announcer sound effect. (Thanks ez_duke)
- Fixed the bug where Telepills had a chance to send you to the Ultra Secret Room. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where you were not able to toggle the map while using a trapdoor.
- Fixed the bug with seeded death where the familiars from Cambion Conception and Immaculate Conception would not return upon revival. (Thanks Gamonymous)
