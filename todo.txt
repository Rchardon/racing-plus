### *v0.59.2* - August 17th, 2021

- 1-item Angel Rooms are now as equally likely as 2-item Angel Rooms. (Previously, it was more likely to get a 1-item Angel Room.)
- Both 3 item Angel Rooms have been deleted so that you can more consistently get items with a low pickup-count.
- The coin, bomb, and key from a Justice card will now be automatically inserted. (Automatic insertion will not happen for a Hermit? card or an Ace card because that would save too much time.) (Thanks Gamonymous)
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- charge ability
- chat system
- custom console
- Charge bars for all of the charge items
	- Azazel's Rage
- automatically open door after going to 2x1 room in mines with completed knife
- Add charge bar for No. 2
- Implement time offsets, show on the first room of each floor
