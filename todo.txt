### *v0.59.0* - August 16th, 2021

- The Racing+ mod is no longer in alpha.
- R+7 Season 1 is now available for beta-testing. You can read more about it here: https://github.com/Zamiell/racing-plus/blob/main/docs/challenges.md#r7-season-1-normal-vs-tainted
- The Treasure Room changes for Season 1 are now applied globally to the mod because it is too complicated to make complex item pool modifications only apply to a specific challenge (due to modding API limitations). With that said, these changes are probably a good idea for all general purpose runs. Since this is a significant change from vanilla, this change is probationary. You can share your feedback in Discord.
- All enemies are now removed from Treasure Rooms.
- You are now able to cancel a fast-travel animation by saving and quitting while the screen is fading to black.
- Fixed the bug where you could switch to The Soul during a trapdoor animation.
