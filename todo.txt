### *v0.58.60* - August 1?th, 2021

- The Treasure Room changes for Season 1 are now applied globally to the mod because it is too complicated to make complex item pool modifications only apply to a specific challenge (due to modding API limitations). With that said, these changes are probably a good idea for all general purpose runs. Since this is a significant change from vanilla, this change is probationary. You can share your feedback in Discord.
- An optional feature is added that removes all enemies from Treasure Rooms.
- Fixed the bug where you could switch to The Soul during a trapdoor animation.
