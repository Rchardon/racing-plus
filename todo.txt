### *v0.74.0* - December 4th, 2021

- If you are playing a Season 3 Ranked Solo race, the server will now remind you to stream on Twitch or YouTube.
- The free Devil Room item mechanic is reworked:
  - Players are no longer granted a Your Soul trinket.
  - Keeper & Tainted Keeper are no longer granted coins.
  - Instead, all items that cost hearts will be made free until you take damage or take an item that costs hearts, whichever comes first.
  - This applies to every room, not just Devil Rooms.
- Fixed the bug where you could not take a trophy if you had a Glass Cannon under certain conditions. (Thanks Monkeypot)
- Fixed the bug where Number Magnet did not prevent Krampus from appearing in a Devil Room. (Thanks ez_duke)
- Fixed the bug where damage to child players (e.g. the Strawman Keeper) could count as damage for the purposes of the free Devil Room item mechanic.
- Fixed the bug where Sawblade would not show up properly at the beginning of a race. (Thanks Gamonymous)
```

TODO Racing+ new features:
- write TSTL plugin to insert a comment at the top of the file
- write TSTL plugin to insert a debug statement in between every line
