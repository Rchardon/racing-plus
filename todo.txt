### *v0.68.2* - September 16th, 2021

- Pin, Frail, and Scolex will now spend less time underground after performing a non-jump attack.
- Wormwood room #5182 was modified to remove the pits next to the doors, which gives the player slightly more time to react to the faster Wormwood mechanic. (Thanks Moucheron Quipet)
- Removed the Cathedral room where Bumbino is trapped behind rocks. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where the health for Tainted Lost would be misaligned when they had Birthright. (Thanks Gamonymous)
- Fixed the bug where some flipped versions of Utero room #975 would make the Wall Huggers move in ways that was not intended. (Thanks Gamonymous)
