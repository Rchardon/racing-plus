# Racing+ Mod Known Bugs

Some gameplay-related bugs are not fixable due to the limitations of the game's Lua API.

<br />

## Miscellaneous Bugs

- Antibirth doors are not spawned after a boss dies. (You can get them to appear by exiting and re-entering the room.)
  - Furthermore, when re-entering a room with an Antibirth door, it will sometimes be automatically opened (without having to use a key, bomb, etc.).

<!--
- When returning to the Boss Rush from a crawlspace, the camera will jerk from the door to the location of the crawlspace.
- In a multi-character speedrun, if you save and quit on the frame that the Checkpoint spawns, then you will also spawn a trophy. (Reported by thereisnofuture)
- Bob's Bladder produces green creep instead of blue. (Reported by PassionDrama)
- If The Forgotten or The Soul falls into a pitfall and dies, then the game will lock up for a few seconds. (Reported by Gamonymous)
- If there are multiple The Haunts in a room, all of the Lil Haunts will be detached at once, because tracking the individual ones is too difficult. (Reported by thereisnofuture)
