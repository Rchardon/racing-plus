# Racing+ Mod Custom Challenges

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

- By pressing "Tab" on the challenges portion of the main menu, you can access custom challenges added by mods. The Racing+ mod uses custom challenges to facilitate multi-character speedruns where you must beat the game multiple times in a row on various characters.
- These custom challenges will automatically take you to the next character so that you never have to return to the menu. They will also show a timer on the screen and your current character progress.
- You can restart with the current character by tapping R. You can go back to the first character by holding R.
  - On floors 2 and beyond, you can double-tap R to restart with the current character.

## Shared Speedrun Mechanics

- In all seasons, the first character will get More Options. After the Treasure Room is entered, More Options will be removed. (This is to speed up the process of finding an item and getting a run going.)
- In all seasons, both The Polaroid and The Negative will spawn after defeating Mom. Neither are required to travel to The Chest / the Dark Room. (This is to increase strategy and decision making.)
- In all seasons, on the first character, Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms will have nothing in them if you teleport to one from a Curse Room on the first floor. (This prevents resetting for a Devil Room item.)

### Goal

- The 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th runs will go to The Chest.
- The 2nd, 4th, and 6th runs will go to the Dark Room.

### Storage

#### Basic Description

- When holding a collectible above your head, you can hold down the a button to activate a "storage" mechanic.
- When a collectible is stored, it will not be granted to the player, but will go into storage instead.
- All stored collectibles will appear in the starting room of the next character in the speedrun.
- If you do not take a stored collectible in the starting room, it will continue to be stored for future characters.

#### Extra Storage Rules

- You can only store an active collectible on the initial pickup. (In other words, if you have already touched the active collectible on the current run, then you cannot store it.)
- Stored collectibles are removed from pools when you store them (even though they do not go into your inventory).
- Stored collectibles are not removed from pools if they appear in the starting room of the run (but they are removed if you take them).
- Stored collectibles cannot be rolled, voided, duplicated, or moved (with e.g. D6, D100, Eternal D6, Spindown Dice, Void, Abyss, Diplopia, Crooked Penny, Moving Box, or Dice Shard).
- If you reset or die before touching the checkpoint/trophy, any collectibles that you stored on the run will be lost. Items already stored from previous characters will remain. (This prevents you from storing items from the Basement 1 Treasure Room.)

### Item Bans

- The following items are removed from all pools:
  - 84 - We Need to Go Deeper
  - 622 - Genesis
