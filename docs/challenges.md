# Racing+ Mod Custom Challenges

- By pressing "Tab" on the challenges portion of the main menu, you can access custom challenges added by mods. The Racing+ mod uses custom challenges to facilitate multi-character speedruns where you must beat the game multiple times in a row on various characters.
- These custom challenges will automatically take you to the next character so that you never have to return to the menu. They will also show a timer on the screen and your current character progress.
- Before starting a speedrun, you must define a character order by using the "Change Char Order" custom challenge.
- You can restart with the current character by tapping R. You can go back to the first character by holding R.
  - On floors 2 and beyond, you can double-tap R to restart with the current character.

## Shared Speedrun Mechanics

- In all seasons, the first character will get More Options. After the Treasure Room is entered, More Options will be removed. (This is to speed up the process of finding an item and getting a run going.)
- In all seasons, both The Polaroid and The Negative will spawn after defeating Mom. Neither are required to travel to The Chest / the Dark Room. (This is to increase strategy and decision making.)
- In all seasons, on the first character, Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms will have nothing in them if you teleport to one from a Curse Room on Basement 1. (This prevents resetting for a Devil Room item.)

## R+7 Season 1 (Normal vs Tainted)

- You must defeat Blue Baby on the following 7 characters:
  - 0 - Isaac
  - 3 - Judas
  - 7 - Azazel

  - 15 - Bethany
- For each character, you can choose to play as either the normal version or the tainted version.
- Bethany & Tainted Bethany start with Duality in addition to their other items.

## R+7 Season 2 Beta (Instant-Start) (Proposal)

### Characters

- You must complete the game with the following 7 characters:
  - 2 - Cain
  - 5 - Eve
  - 12 - Dark Judas
  - 16 - The Forgotten
  - 21 - Tainted Isaac (with Birthright)
  - 27 - Tainted Samson
  - 28 - Tainted Azazel
- Tainted Isaac starts with Birthright.
- All characters start with the Compass.

### Goal

- The 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th runs will go to The Chest.
- The 2nd, 4th, and 6th runs will go to the Dark Room.

### Random Characters & Instant Start

- You are randomly assigned a character at the beginning of the run. (You cannot choose the order of the characters.)
- You are randomly assigned a build at the beginning of the run. (You can find the full list in the "Change Char Order" custom challenge.)
- Resetting the game will change the seed, but not change the randomly assigned character or build.
- The randomly selected character & build for the first character will expire after 1.5 minutes or when a Basement 2 boss dies, whichever happens first.
- Instead of choosing a character order, players must ban 3 builds.
- When resetting on the first character, you will never be given the same character or build twice in a row.
- Duplicate starting builds will never be given over the course of a 7 character run.

### Seeded Death

- The custom death mechanic from seeded races is applied.
