# Racing+ Mod Custom Challenges

- By pressing "Tab" on the challenges portion of the main menu, you can access custom challenges added by mods. The Racing+ mod uses custom challenges to facilitate multi-character speedruns where you must beat the game multiple times in a row on various characters.
- These custom challenges will automatically take you to the next character so that you never have to return to the menu. They will also show a timer on the screen and your current character progress.
- Before starting a speedrun, you must define a character order by using the "Change Char Order" custom challenge.
- You can restart with the current character by tapping R. You can go back to the first character by holding R.
  - On floors 2 and beyond, you can double-tap R to restart with the current character.

## Shared Speedrun Mechanics

- In all seasons, the first character will get More Options. After the Treasure Room is entered, More Options will be removed. (This is to speed up the process of finding an item and getting a run going.)
- In all seasons, both The Polaroid and The Negative will spawn after defeating Mom. Neither are required to travel to The Chest / the Dark Room. (This is to increase strategy and decision making.)
- In all seasons, on the first character, Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms will have nothing in them if you teleport to one from a Curse Room on Basement 1. (This prevents resetting for a Devil Room item.)
