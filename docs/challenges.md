# Racing+ Mod Custom Challenges

- By pressing "Tab" on the challenges portion of the main menu, you can access custom challenges added by mods. The Racing+ mod uses custom challenges to facilitate multi-character speedruns where you must beat the game multiple times in a row on various characters.
- These custom challenges will automatically take you to the next character so that you never have to return to the menu. They will also show a timer on the screen and your current character progress.
- Before starting a speedrun, you must define a character order by using the "Change Char Order" custom challenge.
- You can restart with the current character by tapping R. You can go back to the first character by holding R.
  - On floors 2 and beyond, you can double-tap R to restart with the current character.
