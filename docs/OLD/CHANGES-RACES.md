# Racing+ Race Formats

On Racing+, players have the option to choose from different kinds of races.

<br />

## Unseeded

- Historically, most races have been unseeded. This means that both players start with the same character but play on different seeds.
- Each player is allowed to reset as many times as they want. Typically, each player will reset over and over until they find a good starting item from the Basement 1 Treasure Room.
- In unseeded races, there are additional balance changes:
  - Each racer starts with More Options. More Options is removed upon entering the first Treasure Room.
  - The following items have a 50% chance to be rerolled into something else if found in a Basement 1 Treasure Room:
    - Mom's Knife --> Mutant Spider + The Inner Eye
    - Tech X --> Crown of Light
    - Epic Fetus --> Sacred Heart
    - Ipecac --> Incubus

<br />

## Seeded

- In seeded races, both players play on the same seed. (This means that they should get all of the same items, bosses, and so forth.)
- Resetting is allowed, but it will just take a player back to the beginning of the same seed.
- Each player will start with a pre-defined starting item that is chosen before the match, such as Cricket's Head or Mom's Knife.
- The Basement 1 Treasure Room is barred. (This is to prevent players from starting with 2 items instead of 1.)
- All characters start with The Compass and the Schoolbag in addition to their other items.
- If the character is supposed to start with an item that is not the D6, that item will be inside the Schoolbag.
- Some additional things are guaranteed to be seeded:
  - Room drops (given in order)
  - Level generation (consistent special rooms)
  - Devil Room rewards (given in order)
  - Angel Room rewards (given in order)
- The following things no longer affect room drops:
  - Luck (always uses a value of 0 luck)
  - Rib of Greed
  - Smelter
  - Guppy's Tail
- There is a custom death mechanic:
  - Instead of dying, players will respawn in the previous room with 1.5 soul hearts.
  - They will have a "debuff" effect that removes all of the items. The debuff will last 45 seconds.
  - This mechanic does not apply to deaths in Devil Rooms, Sacrifice Rooms, or the Boss Rush. (Deaths in those rooms will be permanent.)
- Lucky Foot is removed from all pools.
- The Cain's Eye, Broken Ankh, Silver Dollar, Bloody Crown, Daemon's Tail, Child's Heart, Rusted Key, Match Stick, Lucky Toe, Safety Cap, Ace of Spades, and Watch Battery trinkets are removed from the trinket pool.

<br />

## Diversity

- Diversity races are similar to unseeded races in that each player plays on different seeds and is allowed to reset as much as they want.
- However, each racer starts with the same five random items. (This is in addition to the character's original passive items and resources.)
- For additional information, see [the documentation for diversity races](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/README-DIVERSITY.md).

<br />

## Custom

- There are no additional changes to the game in this format.
- Custom allows people to race with their own custom rules. For example, you could make a race where you are not allowed to pick up any Devil Room items.
- Make sure that everyone in the race knows the rules before starting.
- This option is used for multi-character speedrun races.

<br />

# Racing+ Race Goals

On Racing+, players have the option for races to end at different places.

<br />

## Blue Baby

- Historically, most races have had the goal of killing Blue Baby, the boss at the end of The Chest.
- There are no additional changes to the game for this goal.

<br />

## The Lamb

- The Lamb is the boss at the end of the Dark Room.
- In Racing+, 4 gold chests will always spawn at the beginning of the Dark Room (instead of 4 red chests).
- Teleporting to the Dark Room via a Sacrifice Room on floors 1 through 8 will send you to the next floor instead.

<br />

## Mega Satan

- Mega Satan is the boss behind the giant locked door. Players are allowed to take either path to get to Mega Satan.
- The door to Mega Satan will automatically open upon reaching The Chest or the Dark Room.
- Teleporting to the Dark Room via a Sacrifice Room on floors 1 through 8 will send you to the next floor instead.

<br />

## Everything

- This goal requires you to kill Isaac, Satan, Blue Baby, The Lamb, and Mega Satan, in order.
- Both The Polaroid and The Negative will spawn after defeating Mom. Neither are required to complete the run.
- After defeating It Lives!, the beam of light will always spawn to take you to The Cathedral.
- After defeating Isaac, a trapdoor will spawn to take you to Sheol.
- After defeating Satan, a beam of light will spawn to take you to The Chest.
- After defeating Blue Baby, a trapdoor will spawn to take you to the Dark Room.
- After defeating The Lamb, backtrack to the starting room and the Mega Satan door will automatically open.
- Defeat Mega Satan to complete the run.
- Teleporting to the Dark Room via a Sacrifice Room on floors 1 through 8 will send you to the next floor instead.

<br />

## Custom

- There are no additional changes to the game for this goal.
- Custom allows people to race with their own custom goals. For example, you could make a race where the goal is to beat Mom as fast as possible.
- Make sure that everyone in the race knows the goal before starting.
- This option is used for multi-character speedrun races.
