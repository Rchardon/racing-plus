# Common Complaints from Non-Speedrunners

*[This was originally posted on Reddit after AGDQ 2020. Some additional edits have been made.]*

Whenever an Isaac race, tournament, or mod is shown to the general public, the same sort of complaints seem to surface over and over in the Twitch chat. "Using powerful builds takes no skill!" "Using a mod instead of the vanilla game is stupid!" And so forth. Since I was on the couch at the time, I actually meant to talk about this at length during the AGDQ 2020 run, but there is really so much to explain and cover that I didn't get around to it. (And even if I did, I probably would not have done a very good job, because this is complicated material that is hard to condense.) However, I'll try to address some of these complaints more thoroughly now. So let's talk about The Binding of Isaac.

Preface: In this post, I use the word "casual" to describe gameplay that is not speedrunning. This is generally how the word is used in the speedrunning world. Note that this is not intended to be pejorative in any way. "Casual player" is simply a shorter way to write the words "non-speedrunning player".

<br />

### Complaint #1 - Speedrunning Isaac is not the real way to play the game.

While a lot of seeds in Isaac can be beaten easily, a good portion of seeds are really difficult. Thus, in order to consistently beat the game with a really high win rate, players typically need to "squeeze" the most that they can out of any particular seed from the get go, just in case the second half of the run is extremely difficult (e.g. you randomly get the hardest bosses and randomly get no useful items later on).

Squeezing the most out of every run tends to lead to slow, methodical gameplay, lots of backtracking, and lots of "min-maxing". This type of gameplay can be really fun to watch in certain contexts. For example, [Larsfest](https://www.twitch.tv/larsfest) is one of the most popular "Eden streakers" on Twitch and is really skilled at the game. Watching him barely survive a really, really bad seed and finally come out on top in the end is a satisfying experience.

But it is important to realize that this kind of careful, plodding gameplay is not really conducive to a speedrun setting. Speedrunners do not have time to backtrack and squeeze the most out of every seed - they are trying to beat the game as fast as possible. Subsequently, the main strategy is to progress to the next floor as soon as possible. The type of gameplay that you will see on Larsfest's Twitch channel is drastically different from the action-packed, fast-paced, every-second-matters gameplay that you saw in today's AGDQ run. Both ways of playing the game can be valid - it would be incorrect to label one or the other as the "true" way to play the game.

<br />

### Complaint #2 - Speedrunning Isaac takes no skill.

A typical speedrun involves a player resetting over and over until they get one of the most powerful items in the game from the first floor Treasure Room. And from then on, they avoid damage and "get" all of their devil deals, becoming even more powerful. Often times, the build can snowball into something insane that many casual players rarely get to play or see.

From the perspective of someone unfamiliar with speedrunning, this trivializes the game. The thing that makes players like [Larsfest](https://www.twitch.tv/larsfest) extremely skilled are their ability to dodge attacks and kill enemies, even on the worst possible builds. When speedrunners have such big tears that they destroy everything in one hit, how could it possibly take any skill to be a speedrunner? When speedrunners take sloppy hits from enemies that most casual players could avoid with ease, how could this possibly be impressive?

When put that way, it is hard to see speedrunning as anything more than "getting lucky". But this could not be further from the truth. And the best way to show why is to explain seeded racing.

The Isaac speedrunning community loves to compete with each other - we have held over a hundred tournaments with a variety of rules and formats. But undoubtedly, the best way to find the most skilled player is to do a "seeded" race - a race where both players play on the exact same seed, have the exact same items, the exact same layout, and so forth. In this context, both of the players might have a "powerful build that trivializes the game". But the best players in the world could perform 10 races in a row with such a build against a lesser player and **not lose a single game**. In fact, while most seeded races are around 12 minutes long, the best players in the world will often win by **1-2 entire minutes or more**.

What makes the best players so fast? Movement. (And strategy. But let's leave that for the next section.) To start with, one basic thing that all of the best runners do is to clear a room in such a way that they finish as close as possible to the exit door. This way, they can immediately slip out of the door, saving valuable seconds. When stated like this, it kind of sounds commonsensical and simple. But this is the kind of thing that a non-speedrunner would never have to think about, because normally, it is irrelevant how you move through a room - as long as you don't take damage, anything goes!

Let's reflect on the profundity of this for a moment. You could define an Isaac player going from "level 1" to "level 2" once they have mastered all of the attack patterns of the enemies in the game and hardly ever take damage. But that is only the beginning. To go from "level 2" to "level 3", you would not only have to avoid all damage, but you would also have to kill the enemies in the fastest way possible. And to go from "level 3" to "level 4", you would have to be familiar with the thousands of rooms in the game in order to take advantage of room-specific optimizations.

Merely going from level 1 to level 2 can take hundreds of hours of gameplay. But getting all the way to level 4 takes a lot longer. The best players in the world all have thousands of hours under their belt. And not one of them "appeared on the scene" from nowhere. Rather, each player steadily got good over the course of years of play.

From a non-speedrunning perspective, level 4 movement is very difficult to appreciate, because your focus is going to be on the build - huge tears, homing lasers, big ass missiles, and so forth. But take a step back and notice how a player finishes a room right next to the exit door, notice how the player is effectively weaves in and out between enemies to use their orbitals for maximum damage, notice how the player cancels pickup animations (e.g. by using a pill in a boss room) in order to shave off a mere second or two. Once you are familiar with speedrunning, you may come around to the opinion that it takes more precise inputs, more practice, and more raw skill to be the best speedrunner than it takes to be the best Eden Streaker (or any other way to play the game).

### Complaint #3 - Speedrunning Isaac takes no strategy.

One beautiful thing about The Binding of Isaac is that it is filled with strategies that reward clever players who want to squeeze the most out of a run. For example, players like [Larsfest](https://www.twitch.tv/larsfest) will always visit a shop first before entering a Treasure Room in case the shop happens to have More Options in it. As another example, players can use the invulnerability frames from a Ventricle Razor to give "free" donations to a Blood Donation Machine over and over. As experienced players will know, more and more of these kinds of strategies will accumulate in your brain the more and more you play the game. In fact, much of the "skill" in Isaac can be said to be simply accumulating more and more of these tricks and strategies.

In a speedrun, it would be a waste of time to visit the shop before a Treasure Room. And it would certainly be a waste of time to spend 2-3 minutes using a Ventricle Razor on a Blood Donation Machine in order to get an extra Blood Bank. Thus, it can be said that by removing the slow-play element of the game, you also remove an big amount of strategy.

While this is certainly true, casual observers may not be considering that there is also an insane amount of speedrunning strategy. Runners are constantly weighing which items to roll (depending on the item strength and the item pool), how to manage their bomb count (knowing which specific rooms are valuable to bomb out of), and how aggressively to play (which depends on the heart count and the build power). Of course, these are all things that are also present in casual play, but in speedrunning they are often split-second decisions that are made on the spot, with no time to ruminate. This in turn makes mastery of them harder.

Additionally, consider that some decisions in particular are trivially easy for casual players, but extremely complicated for speedrunners. As a quick example, we could pose the question: "Is it worth it to backtrack 2 rooms in order to re-roll a Treasure Room? What about backtracking 3 rooms?" These are questions with unclear answers that depend on several factors, such as your own personal evaluation of the average expected value of the Treasure Room item pool, the overall power level of your current item build, whether or not there is a specific synergy that you are looking for that would transform your build, whether or not you are ahead or behind your current race opponent, and more. Conversely, in a casual run, these are non-decisions - you would go back to roll an item room even if it was 20 rooms away, so there is no thought or planning involved in this decision whatsoever.

In fact, one of the defining elements that makes the best speedrunners in the world stand out from the mid-tier players is that they are smarter. Newer players will often be surprised at some of the decisions made by top players - they seem to have an uncanny ability to stumble upon powerful synergies more often than other people. And with over 100 tournament results to look through, we can definitively say that it is not not due to luck.

### Complaint #4 - Using a mod is cheating and/or alienating. Why play with a mod at all?

An important part of any competitive game is consistency. For the best players to be able to consistently win tournaments, they need to be able to complete a game without any major curveballs being thrown at them that are out of their control.

For example, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of the most popular speedrun games out there. Imagine that in an OoT speedrun, the last end boss of Ganon was poorly programmed and had a 10% chance to crash the game during the fight. In this hypothetical, OoT would still be a really skill-based game to speedrun and race, but it would have some really unexpected (and really undeserved) tournament results from time to time.

For The Binding of Isaac, this is not a hypothetical. In several interviews, Edmund McMillen has stated that **he intentionally designed The Binding of Isaac to have some seeds that are virtually unwinnable** for the player. While this may seem like a strange design decision, it is part of his vision for the game: some runs should be ridiculously overpowered, with tears so big that they take up the entire screen. And some runs should be underpowered such that it is impossible to defeat the stronger bosses, even for the most skilled player in the world. In this sense, **Edmund wanted the game to be [a metaphor for life itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/2m33ys/i_am_the_author_of_the_isaac_endings_explained/)**.

From an artistic perspective, this is a fantastic design decision, and I can side with Edmund here - it is one of the things that makes the game really stand out and have a special place in people's hearts. However, from an e-sports or competitive perspective, this is not so good.

Isaac speedrunners and racers are completely fine with having "good" runs and "bad" runs - the random elements are what keep us coming back for more and more after thousands of hours. But at the very least, we would prefer that the game be designed in such a way that it is at least possible for the best player in the world to **complete** any arbitrary run. I don't think that that is asking too much.

So do speedrunners have to grit their teeth and just accept that a certain percentage of their runs will end in failure, even if they play perfectly? No, because that is where modding comes in. Handily, in Afterbirth+ (the last DLC for the game), Edmund had the foresight to add a modding API, allowing anyone to easily program a mod for the game in the Lua programming language. And thus, Racing+ was born - a mod to alter the balance of the game very slightly in order to make beating the game slightly more consistent. (The mod also streamlines gameplay, removes bullshit completely-unavoidable damage rooms, removes unnecessary animations, fixes stray bugs that the developers have not bothered to fix in the vanilla game, and more.)

So, hopefully that is a convincing explanation on why the Isaac speedrunning community uses a mod to play the game. Obviously, it is not strictly necessary to speedrun the game with a mod. But the game itself was definitely not designed with competitive play in mind, and with a few tweaks here and there, we can really make the game perfect for speedrunning.

<br />

### Complaint #5 - Using a mod to make the game easier is lame. Powerful builds that result from a mod are stupid.

With respect to balance, let's be clear about what exactly the Racing+ mod does.

#### 1) The D6

The mod gives all characters the D6.

Having the D6 adds a crap-ton of strategy in having to plan out your rolls throughout the run. It also makes the game much more consistent, because you can improve most of the bad items that you happen to get, on average. (And from the previous section, we know how important consistency is.) Because of these two things, when people started to get into racing the game back in 2013, races were only performed on Isaac, the character who normally starts with the D6. The D6 was so important that no other characters were ever really used.

Without modding, that is likely still the way that things would be. But variety is important. By giving every character the D6, it "unlocks" the ability for every character to be played in races and in speedruns.

Certainly, having the D6 makes the game easier, but there is a pretty good reason for it.

#### 2) No Curses

The mod removes all curses.

At first glance, turning curses off clearly makes the game easier. But when we go into the nitty-gritty details and examine each curse, none of them actually make the game more skill-based or improves gameplay. One example of a potentially-well-designed curse would be something like a Curse of Double Damage - skilled players would be able to adjust and play more defensively in order to mitigate the effects. But none of the actual curses in the game really function in this way. Rather, they largely rob the player of autonomy and decision making. While Isaac is generally considered extremely well-designed, we feel that the curse system is one of Edmund's major blunders, especially when viewing the game in a competitive context.

#### 3) Devil Deals and Angel Deals

The average expected pedestals from a devil deal is increased from 1.53 to 1.86 and the average expected pedestals from an angel deal is increased from 1.65 to 1.88.

This is the only "behind the scenes"-style balance change that Racing+ performs, with the aim of slightly increasing the reward for skilled players who play well and do not take any red-heart damage. Hopefully you can agree that this is a relatively modest increase.

These are the 3 changes - that's it. Notably, the mod does not change the item pools or item strengths in any way. The overall difficulty of a Racing+ speedrun is extremely similar to just playing a run on the vanilla game with the Isaac character.

(If you think that more generally, playing Isaac with powerful items is cheap, refer to the Complaint #2 section.)

<br />

### Complaint #6 - Having the mod "give" you at starting item at the beginning is cheating.

This mechanic only applies to [season 4, season 5, and season 6](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/CHANGES-CHALLENGES.md), which are optional custom challenges that change the normal rules a bit and, well, give speedrunners a unique challenge. (StoneAgeMarcus was doing the season 6 category for his run at AGDQ.)

Getting a "free" powerful item at the beginning of a run may seem a little bit like cheating. But what is the alternative? Consider that if the player was playing a "normal" run, you would see them reset the game over and over, going into all of the Treasure Rooms until they found a starting item like Magic Mushroom of Mom's Knife. And after that, they would continue on with the run. Notice that, for all intents and purposes, this is exactly the same as just starting with a random item from the get-go. The only difference is that it just saves the runner and the viewers the monotony of having to sit through the boring resetting section.

<br />

### Complaint #7 - Having the mod make you a ghost for 45 seconds instead of killing you is cheating.

This mechanic only applies to [season 6](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/CHANGES-CHALLENGES.md) and seeded races. Thus, it is important to remember that in most speedruns and races, speedrunners are not "saved" by this mechanic. (StoneAgeMarcus was doing the season 6 category for his run at AGDQ.)

With respect to the AGDQ run, if the custom death mechanic was turned off, then Marcus would have to play a bit more carefully, and the gameplay would more closely match the non-modded game. However, note that the run would not be very marathon-safe - if Marcus accidentally died on a character near the end of the run, he would have to start all the way over from the beginning, potentially losing up to 10 minutes. This is why season 6 was the best category choice for AGDQ.
