## Design Goals

In terms of what to change about the game, the mod has several goals, and attempts to strike a balance between them. However, certain things are prioritized. The goals are listed below in order of importance:

1. to reward skillful play (in the context of speedrunning and racing)
1. to make the game more fun to play
1. to fix bugs and imperfections
1. to keep the game as "vanilla" as possible

## List of Main Changes

### 1) Character Changes

- All characters now start with the D6. (Much of the strategy in the game is centered around having this item and it heavily mitigates run disparity.) <code>001</code>
- Certain characters have their starting health changed so that they can consistently take a devil deal:
  - Judas starts with half a red heart and half a soul heart.
  - Blue Baby starts with an extra half soul heart.
  - Azazel starts with an extra half soul heart.
- Judas starts with a bomb instead of 3 coins.
- Samson no longer starts with the Child's Heart. (This is a quality of life change, since the Child's Heart is usually immediately dropped.)
- Eden starts with the Schoolbag. They will start with their random active item inside the bag. (This is to preserve Eden's random active item.)

### 2) No Curses

All curses are automatically disabled.

### 3) Devil Room & Angel Room Rebalancing

Since Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms are the most skill-based component of the game, their rewards have been [slightly rebalanced](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/CHANGES-ROOM.md#devil-room-rebalancing).

### 4) Wrath of the Lamb Style Room Clear

Rooms are considered cleared at the beginning of an enemy's death animation, rather than the end. (This was the way the game was originally intended to be, but it was incorrectly ported to Rebirth.)

### 5) Room Fixes

Hundreds of rooms with unavoidable damage or bugs have been fixed or deleted.

### 6) Room Flipping

While there are thousands of rooms in the game, many players have already seen them all. To increase run variety, all rooms have a chance to be flipped on the X axis, Y axis, or both axes.
